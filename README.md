# SAMLVEGAN
  
  SAMLVEGAN is something I started on to refresh my Python knowledge. It is right now just a base FLASK api setup and mongodb calls to write and access information. It is not published anywhere yet, the only reaso there is a public commit is because I wanted to show working in progress. The end product will be GPL but also have some security and such like.
